## About

This repo contains the front end code for [Beginning Brawn](https://beginning-brawn.herokuapp.com/), a weight lifting app. It guides users through a variant of the well-known strength training program, Starting Strength.

Not only can users log their workouts and track their progress, but the app provides personalized suggestions for weight and set/rep schemas that closely follow the Starting Strength programming, with a few alterations of my choosing.

Below you can see an example of a workout log:
